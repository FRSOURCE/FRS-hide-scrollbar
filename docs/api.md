To make the scrollbar of your element/s hidden just initialize FRSHideScrollbar library on it/them:

```javascript
new FRSHideScrollBar(/* <element>|<array of elements> */);

```

And that's it! Now FRSHideScrollbar library will detect if hiding of a scrollbar is needed and will apply correct styling/html changes.
